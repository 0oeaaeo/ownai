# OpenAI

[OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) offers a spectrum of [models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) with different levels of power suitable for different tasks.

The examples in this directory show how to connect ownAI with openAI. ownAI uses the API of openAI, i.e. the AI models are executed on the servers of openAI. You need an API key from openAI for this.

## Set up

To use these AIs, you should set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your API key (in ownAI, select "Connect to external AI providers" in the user menu in the upper right corner, or set the variables globally in your server's `.env` file).
Then download the aifile and load it with ownAI (in ownAI, click on the logo in the upper left corner to open the menu, then select "AI Workshop", then "New AI" and "Load Aifile").

## Privacy

These AIs are run by an external service provider. Your requests will be sent to an external server. Please refer to the provider's privacy policy for details.
