# GPT4All

[GPT4All](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all) is an ecosystem of open-source chatbots trained on massive collections of clean assistant data including code, stories and dialogue.

This allows you to run [supported models](https://gpt4all.io/) on your own machine!

## Set up

No additional set up is required. However on first use of these Aifiles the models will be downloaded, which needs some time and several gigabytes of disk space.

## Privacy

These AIs are running on your own machine.
