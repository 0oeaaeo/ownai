# GPT4All

[GPT4All](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all) is an ecosystem of open-source chatbots trained on massive collections of clean assistant data including code, stories and dialogue.

This allows you to run [supported models](https://gpt4all.io/) on your own machine!

## Set up

To use these AIs, please download the aifile and load it with ownAI (in ownAI, click on the logo in the upper left corner to open the menu, then select "AI Workshop", then "New AI" and "Load Aifile").

No additional set up is required. However on first use of these Aifiles the models will be downloaded, which needs some time and several gigabytes of disk space.

## Privacy

These AIs are running on your own machine.
