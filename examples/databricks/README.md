# Databricks

The [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/) Lakehouse Platform unifies data, analytics, and AI on one platform.

## Prerequisites

- An LLM was registered and deployed to [a Databricks serving endpoint](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/model-serving/index.html).
- You have ["Can Query" permission](https://docs.databricks.com/security/auth-authz/access-control/serving-endpoint-acl.html) to the endpoint.

## Set up

To use these AIs, you should set the environment variables `DATABRICKS_HOST` and `DATABRICKS_API_TOKEN` (e.g. in your server's `.env` file).

## Privacy

Your models are running on an external provider's infrastructure. Please refer to the provider's privacy policy for details.
