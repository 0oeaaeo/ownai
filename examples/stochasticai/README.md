# StochasticAI

[Stochastic AI](https://docs.stochastic.ai/docs/introduction/) aims to simplify the life cycle of a Deep Learning model. From uploading and versioning the model, through training, compression and acceleration to putting it into production.

## Set up

To use these AIs, you should set the environment variable `STOCHASTICAI_API_KEY` with your API key (in ownAI, select "Connect to external AI providers" in the user menu in the upper right corner, or set the variables globally in your server's `.env` file).
Then download the aifile and load it with ownAI (in ownAI, click on the logo in the upper left corner to open the menu, then select "AI Workshop", then "New AI" and "Load Aifile").
