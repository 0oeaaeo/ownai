# Aviary

[Aviary](https://github.com/ray-project/aviary) is an open source tooklit for evaluating and deploying production open source LLMs.

## Set up

To use these AIs, you should set the environment variable `AVIARY_URL` and optionally `AVIARY_TOKEN` (e.g. in your server's `.env` file).
Then download the aifile and load it with ownAI (in ownAI, click on the logo in the upper left corner to open the menu, then select "AI Workshop", then "New AI" and "Load Aifile").

## Privacy

You can use Aviary to host your AIs yourself or use the infrastructure of an external provider. Privacy depends on how you set up your models.
