# Aviary

[Aviary](https://github.com/ray-project/aviary) is an open source tooklit for evaluating and deploying production open source LLMs.

## Set up

To use these AIs, you should set the environment variable `AVIARY_URL` and optionally `AVIARY_TOKEN` (e.g. in your server's `.env` file).

## Privacy

You can use Aviary to host your AIs yourself or use the infrastructure of an external provider. Privacy depends on how you set up your models.
