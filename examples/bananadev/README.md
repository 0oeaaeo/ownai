# Banana

[Banana](https://www.banana.dev/) is focused on building the machine learning infrastructure for the digital economy.
You can deploy and run your AI models and only pay for what you use.

## Set up

To use these AIs, you should set the environment variable `BANANA_API_KEY` with your API key (e.g. in your server's `.env` file).
Then download the aifile and load it with ownAI (in ownAI, click on the logo in the upper left corner to open the menu, then select "AI Workshop", then "New AI" and "Load Aifile").

## Privacy

Your models are running on an external provider's infrastructure. Please refer to the provider's privacy policy for details.
