# Beam

[Beam](https://docs.beam.cloud/introduction) makes it easy to run code on GPUs, deploy scalable web APIs, schedule cron jobs, and run massively parallel workloads â€” without managing any infrastructure.

## Set up

To use these AIs, you should set the environment variables `BEAM_CLIENT_ID` and `BEAM_CLIENT_SECRET` (e.g. in your server's `.env` file).

## Privacy

Your models are running on an external provider's infrastructure. Please refer to the provider's privacy policy for details.
