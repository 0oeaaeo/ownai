# Beam

[Beam](https://docs.beam.cloud/introduction) makes it easy to run code on GPUs, deploy scalable web APIs, schedule cron jobs, and run massively parallel workloads â€” without managing any infrastructure.

## Set up

To use these AIs, you should set the environment variables `BEAM_CLIENT_ID` and `BEAM_CLIENT_SECRET` (in ownAI, select "Connect to external AI providers" in the user menu in the upper right corner, or set the variables globally in your server's `.env` file).
Then download the aifile and load it with ownAI (in ownAI, click on the logo in the upper left corner to open the menu, then select "AI Workshop", then "New AI" and "Load Aifile").

## Privacy

Your models are running on an external provider's infrastructure. Please refer to the provider's privacy policy for details.
