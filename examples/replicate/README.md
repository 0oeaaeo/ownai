# Replicate

[Replicate](https://replicate.com/) runs machine learning models in the cloud. They have a library of open-source [models](https://replicate.com/explore) and if youâ€™re building your own machine learning models, Replicate makes it easy to deploy them at scale.

## Set up

To use these AIs, you should set the environment variable `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` with your API key (e.g. in your server's `.env` file).
Then download the aifile and load it with ownAI (in ownAI, click on the logo in the upper left corner to open the menu, then select "AI Workshop", then "New AI" and "Load Aifile").

## Privacy

These AIs are run by an external service provider. Your requests will be sent to an external server. Please refer to the provider's privacy policy for details.
