# ForefrontAI

The [ForefrontAI](https://www.forefront.ai/) platform gives you the ability to fine-tune and use [open source large language models](https://docs.forefront.ai/forefront/master/models).

## Set up

To use these AIs, you should set the environment variable `FOREFRONTAI_API_KEY` with your API key (e.g. in your server's `.env` file).
Then download the aifile and load it with ownAI (in ownAI, click on the logo in the upper left corner to open the menu, then select "AI Workshop", then "New AI" and "Load Aifile").

## Privacy

These AIs are run by an external service provider. Your requests will be sent to an external server. Please refer to the provider's privacy policy for details.
