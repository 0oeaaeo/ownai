# C Transformers

The [C Transformers](https://github.com/marella/ctransformers) library provides Python bindings for GGML models.

This allows you to run [supported models](https://github.com/marella/ctransformers#supported-models) on your own machine!

## Set up

No additional set up is required. However on first use of these Aifiles the models will be downloaded, which needs some time and several gigabytes of disk space.

## Privacy

These AIs are running on your own machine.
