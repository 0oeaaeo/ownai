# Hugging Face Pipeline

The `HuggingFacePipeline` allows you to run Hugging Face models locally.

This allows you to run all [Hugging Face Hub models](https://huggingface.co/models) on your own machine â€“ provided your computer has enough resources to run large models.

## Set up

No additional set up is required. However on first use of these Aifiles the models will be downloaded, which needs some time and several gigabytes of disk space.

## Privacy

These AIs are running on your own machine.
